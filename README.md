Install via git url with: https://github.com/NewWorkDesignLab/MUES-Core.git?path=/package

If you want your avatar or other objects to be visible during loading, assign it the "MUES_RenderWhileLoading" Layer!

For correct use, please add the MUES-Core.Runtime namespace under "Assemblies to Weave" in the Fusion Network Config!

Still a Work in Progress! :)
